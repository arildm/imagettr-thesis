  title = {Intuitionistic {{Type Theory}}},
  abstract = {Intuitionistic type theory (also constructive type theory orMartin-L{\"o}f type theory) is a formal logical system and philosophicalfoundation for constructive mathematics. It is afull-scale system which aims to play a similar role for constructivemathematics as Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory does forclassical mathematics. It is based on the propositions-as-typesprinciple and clarifies the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretationof intuitionistic logic. It extends this interpretation to the moregeneral setting of intuitionistic type theory and thus provides ageneral conception not only of what a constructive proof is, but alsoof what a constructive mathematical object is. The main idea is thatmathematical concepts such as elements, sets and functions areexplained in terms of concepts from programming such as datastructures, data types and programs. This article describes the formalsystem of intuitionistic type theory and its semantic foundations., In this entry, we first give an overview of the most importantaspects of intuitionistic type theory\textemdash{}a kind of ``extendedabstract''. It is meant for a reader who is already somewhatfamiliar with the theory. Section 2 on the other hand, is meant for areader who is new to intuitionistic type theory but familiar withtraditional logic, including propositional and predicate logic,arithmetic, and set theory. Here we informally introduce severalaspects which distinguishes intuitionistic type theory from thesetraditional theories. In Section 3 we present a basic version of thetheory, close to Martin-L{\"o}f's first published version from1972. The reader who was intrigued by the informality of Section 2will now see in detail how the theory is built up. Section 4 thenpresents a number of important extensions of the basic theory. Inparticular, it emphasizes the central role of inductive (andinductive-recursive) definitions. Section 5 introduces the underlyingphilosophical ideas including the theory of meaning developed byMartin-L{\"o}f. While Section 5 is about philosophy and foundations,Section 6 gives an overview of mathematical models of the theory. InSection 7 finally, we describe several important variations of thecore Martin-L{\"o}f ``intensional'' theory described inSection 3 and 4.},

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

@misc{LoganComputationalAnalysisApprehension1996,
  title = {A {{Computational Analysis}} of the {{Apprehension}} of {{Spatial Relations}}},
  abstract = {Basic, deictic, \& intrinsic spatial relations distinguished in the literature motivate the proposal that apprehension of spatial relations requires (1) spatial indexing to instantiate basic relations, (2) reference frame computation to adjust parameters of the representation, (3) spatial template alignment to specify scope of acceptability of a given relation, \& (4) assessment of goodness of fit of spatial templates. These representations \& processes may be combined in various orders to perform relation judgments, cuing tasks, \& verification tasks. Evidence from previous psychological studies corroborates spatial indexing \& reference frame computation. Four experiments provide new evidence of the computation of goodness of fit between position of the located object \& a spatial template representing the relation that is centered on \& aligned with the reference object. In a production task, Ss (N = 68 undergraduates) indicated regions of space corresponding to areas of greatest acceptability of 12 spatial relations. In a goodness rating task, Ss (N = 32) ranked areas of space as good, acceptable, \& bad examples of 10 spatial relations in sentences corresponding to pictures. Results showed consistent representations of each notion. In a similarity rating task, Ss (N = 101) evaluated equivalence of pairs from a set of 12 lexicalized spatial terms. Similarities posited for underlying conceptual templates account for resemblances in results of goodness \& similarity rating tasks. Finally, a spatial relation judgment task measured reaction times of Ss (N = 48) to stimuli that systematically varied the distance between reference \& located objects. Results showed that distance minimally affected times, thus supporting the idea that spatial templates applied in parallel, rather than serial visual routines, process spatial relationships. It is concluded that spatial templates are useful for description of many spatial relation meanings. 1 Table, 12 Figures, 39 References. L. Lucht},

  abstract = {A theoretical framework for grounding language is introduced that provides a computational path from sensing and motor action to words and speech acts. The approach combines concepts from semiotics and schema theory to develop a holistic approach to linguistic meaning. Schemas serve as structured beliefs that are grounded in an agent's physical environment through a causal-predictive cycle of action and perception. Words and basic speech acts are interpreted in terms of grounded schemas. The framework reflects lessons learned from implementations of several language processing robots. It provides a basis for the analysis and design of situated, multimodal communication systems that straddle symbolic and non-symbolic realms.},

  shorttitle = {Perceptual Semantics},
  doi = {10.1109/ISIC.1990.128445},
  abstract = {The design of an artificial device that can acquire its own perceptually grounded meanings for internally represented control structure is discussed. A perceptual semantics, in which perceptual routines are mapped onto innate conceptual operators, is described. Entities and relations in the environment take on `meaning' for the device in three forms: the connotation, which is the internal encoding of an object within a syntactic discrimination lattice; the annotation, which is a procedural encoding of how connotations are translated into action/perception; and the denotation, which is the action associated with a procedure within the action-percept feedback loop. The author argues against model-theoretic interpretations for semantics of devices interacting within their environment, and in favor of pragmatically determined models of meaning},

  abstract = {Visual question answering (or VQA) is a new and exciting problem that combines natural language processing and computer vision techniques. We present a survey of the various datasets and models that have been used to tackle this task. The first part of the survey details the various datasets for VQA and compares them along some common factors. The second part of this survey details the different approaches for VQA, classified into four types: non-deep learning models, deep learning models without attention, deep learning models with attention, and other models which do not fit into the first three. Finally, we compare the performances of these approaches and provide some directions for future work.},

  title = {Negation in Dialogue},
  abstract = {We consider the nature of negation in di-alogue as revealed by semantic phenomena such as negative dialogue particles, psycholin-guistic experimentation, and dialogue corpora. We examine alternative accounts of negation that can be used in TTR (Type Theory with Records), and conclude that an alternatives-based account which relates to the psycholog-ical notion of negation in simulation seman-tics is most appropriate. We show how this account relates to questions under discussion, dialogical relevance, and metalinguistic nega-tion.},
