  title = {Intuitionistic {{Type Theory}}},
  abstract = {Intuitionistic type theory (also constructive type theory orMartin-L\"of type theory) is a formal logical system and philosophicalfoundation for constructive mathematics. It is afull-scale system which aims to play a similar role for constructivemathematics as Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory does forclassical mathematics. It is based on the propositions-as-typesprinciple and clarifies the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretationof intuitionistic logic. It extends this interpretation to the moregeneral setting of intuitionistic type theory and thus provides ageneral conception not only of what a constructive proof is, but alsoof what a constructive mathematical object is. The main idea is thatmathematical concepts such as elements, sets and functions areexplained in terms of concepts from programming such as datastructures, data types and programs. This article describes the formalsystem of intuitionistic type theory and its semantic foundations., In this entry, we first give an overview of the most importantaspects of intuitionistic type theory\textemdash{}a kind of ``extendedabstract''. It is meant for a reader who is already somewhatfamiliar with the theory. Section 2 on the other hand, is meant for areader who is new to intuitionistic type theory but familiar withtraditional logic, including propositional and predicate logic,arithmetic, and set theory. Here we informally introduce severalaspects which distinguishes intuitionistic type theory from thesetraditional theories. In Section 3 we present a basic version of thetheory, close to Martin-L\"of's first published version from1972. The reader who was intrigued by the informality of Section 2will now see in detail how the theory is built up. Section 4 thenpresents a number of important extensions of the basic theory. Inparticular, it emphasizes the central role of inductive (andinductive-recursive) definitions. Section 5 introduces the underlyingphilosophical ideas including the theory of meaning developed byMartin-L\"of. While Section 5 is about philosophy and foundations,Section 6 gives an overview of mathematical models of the theory. InSection 7 finally, we describe several important variations of thecore Martin-L\"of ``intensional'' theory described inSection 3 and 4.},

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

  abstract = {We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.},

This is formalized in the attentional vector-sum (AVS) model. This computational model accurately predicts linguistic acceptability judgments for spatial terms, under a variety of spatial configurations. In 7 experiments, the predictions of the AVS model are tested against those of 3 competing models. The results support the AVS model and disconfirm its competitors. The authors conclude that the structure of linguistic spatial categories can be partially explained in terms of independently motivated perceptual processes.},

@article{LoganComputationalAnalysisApprehension1996,
  title = {A {{Computational Analysis}} of the {{Apprehension}} of {{Spatial Relations}}},
  abstract = {Basic, deictic, \& intrinsic spatial relations distinguished in the literature motivate the proposal that apprehension of spatial relations requires (1) spatial indexing to instantiate basic relations, (2) reference frame computation to adjust parameters of the representation, (3) spatial template alignment to specify scope of acceptability of a given relation, \& (4) assessment of goodness of fit of spatial templates. These representations \& processes may be combined in various orders to perform relation judgments, cuing tasks, \& verification tasks. Evidence from previous psychological studies corroborates spatial indexing \& reference frame computation. Four experiments provide new evidence of the computation of goodness of fit between position of the located object \& a spatial template representing the relation that is centered on \& aligned with the reference object. In a production task, Ss (N = 68 undergraduates) indicated regions of space corresponding to areas of greatest acceptability of 12 spatial relations. In a goodness rating task, Ss (N = 32) ranked areas of space as good, acceptable, \& bad examples of 10 spatial relations in sentences corresponding to pictures. Results showed consistent representations of each notion. In a similarity rating task, Ss (N = 101) evaluated equivalence of pairs from a set of 12 lexicalized spatial terms. Similarities posited for underlying conceptual templates account for resemblances in results of goodness \& similarity rating tasks. Finally, a spatial relation judgment task measured reaction times of Ss (N = 48) to stimuli that systematically varied the distance between reference \& located objects. Results showed that distance minimally affected times, thus supporting the idea that spatial templates applied in parallel, rather than serial visual routines, process spatial relationships. It is concluded that spatial templates are useful for description of many spatial relation meanings. 1 Table, 12 Figures, 39 References. L. Lucht},

Words and basic speech acts are interpreted in terms of grounded schemas. The framework reflects lessons learned from implementations of several language processing robots.

Since the inferences that human language users draw from the verbal input they receive for the most transcend the capacities of such a system, it can be no more than a basis on which more powerful systems, which are capable of producing those inferences, may then be built. Nevertheless, even within the general setting of first order logic the structure of the ``formulas'' of DRS-languages, i.e. of the Discourse Representation Structures suggest for the components of such a system inference rules that differ somewhat from those usually found in proof systems for the first order predicate calculus and which are, we believe, more in keeping with inference patterns that are actually employed in common sense reasoning.This is why we have decided to publish the present exercise, in spite of the fact that it is not one for which a great deal of originality could be claimed. In fact, it could be argued that the problem addressed in this paper was solved when G\"odel first established the completeness of the system of Principia Mathematica for first order logic. For the DRS-languages we consider here are straightforwardly intertranslatable with standard formulations of the predicate calculus; in fact the translations are so straightforward that any sound and complete proof system for first order logic can be used as a sound and complete proof system for DRSs: simply translate the DRSs into formulas of predicate logic and then proceed as usual. As a matter of fact, this is how one has chosen to proceed in some implementations of DRT, which involve inferencing as well as semantic representation; an example is the Lex system developed jointly by IBM and the University of T\"ubingen (see in particular (Guenthner et al. 1986)).In the light of the close and simple connections between DRT and standard predicate logic, publication of what will be presented in this paper can be justified only in terms of the special mash we have tried to achieve between the general form and the particular rules of our proof system on the one hand and on the other the distinctive architecture of DRS-like semantic representation. Some additional justification is necessary, however, as there exist a number of other proof systems for first order DRT, some of which have pursued more or less the same aims that have motivated the system presented here. We are explicitly aware of those developed by (Koons 1988), (Saurer 1990), (Sedogbo and Eytan 1987), (Reinhart 1989), (Gabbay and Reyle 1994); perhaps there are others. (Sedogbo and Eytan 1987) is a tableau system, and (Reinhart 1989) and (Gabbay and Reyle 1994) are resolution based, goal directed. These systems may promise particular advantages when it comes to implementing inference engines operating on DRS-like premises. But they do not aim to conform to certain canons of actual inferencing by human interpreters of natural language; and indeed the proof procedures they propose depart quite drastically from what one could plausibly assume to go in the head of such an interpreter. Only (Koons 1988) and (Saurer 1990) are, like our system, inspired by the methods of natural deduction. But there are some differences in the choice of basic rules. In particular both (Koons 1988) and (Saurer 1990) have among their primitive rules the Rule of Reiteration, which permits the copying of a DRS condition from a DRS to any of its sub-DRSs. In our system this is a derived rule (see Section 4 below).We will develop our system in several stages. The necessary intuitions and the formal background are provided in Sections 1 and 2. (The formal definitions can be found also in the first two chapters of (Kamp and Reyle 1993). The first system we present is for a sublanguage of the one defined in Section 2, which differs from the full language in that it lacks identity and disjunction. The core of the paper consists of Section 3, where the proof system for this sublanguage is presented, and Section 5, which extends the system for the full language, including disjunctions (Section 5.1) and identity (Section 5.2) and then establishes soundness and completeness for the full system. Section 4 deals with certain derived inference principles.},

The distinctive features of DRT, to be discussed below, arethat it is a mentalist and representationalist theory ofinterpretation, and that it is a theory of the interpretation not onlyof individual sentences but of discourse, as well. In these respectsDRT made a clear break with classical formal semantics, which duringthe 1970s had emanated from Montague's pioneering work (Thomason1974), but in other respects it continued the tradition, e.g., in itsuse of model-theoretical tools. In the meantime, DRT has come to serveas a framework for explaining a wide range of phenomena, but we willconfine our attention to fewer than a handful: anaphora, tense,presupposition, and propositional attitudes.

But today, when huge volumes of visual data inundate our surroundings (due to the explosive growth of image-capturing devices, proliferation of Internet communication means and video sharing services over the World Wide Web), human-centered handling of Big-data flows is impossible anymore. Therefore, it has to be replaced with a machine (computer) supported counterpart. Of course, such an artificial counterpart must be equipped with some cognitive abilities, usually characteristic for a human being. Indeed, in the past decade, a new computer design trend - Cognitive Computer development - is become visible. Cognitive image processing definitely will be one of its main duties. It must be specially mentioned that this trend is a particular case of a much more general movement - the transition from a "computational data-processing paradigm" to a "cognitive information-processing paradigm", which affects today many fields of science, technology, and engineering. This transition is a blessed novelty, but its success is hampered by the lack of a clear delimitation between the notion of data and the notion of information. Elaborating the case of cognitive image processing, the paper intends to clarify these important research issues.},

A complete incorporation of the calculus of $\lambda$-conversion into the theory of types is impossible if we require that $\lambda$x and juxtaposition shall retain their respective meanings as an abstraction operator and as denoting the application of function to argument. But the present partial incorporation has certain advantages from the point of view of type theory and is offered as being of interest on this basis (whatever may be thought of the finally satisfactory character of the theory of types as a foundation for logic and mathematics).For features of the formulation which are not immediately connected with the incorporation of $\lambda$-conversion, we are heavily indebted to Whitehead and Russell, Hilbert and Ackermann, Hilbert and Bernays, and to forerunners of these, as the reader familiar with the works in question will recognize.The class of type symbols is described by the rules that \i{} and o are each type symbols and that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are type symbols then ($\alpha\beta$) is a type symbol: it is the least class of symbols which contains the symbols \i{} and o and is closed under the operation of forming the symbol ($\alpha\beta$) from the symbols $\alpha$ and $\beta$.},

The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) "iconic representations," which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) "categorical representations," which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) "symbolic representations," grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., "An X is a Y that is Z").},

This requires a framework where intensions are (i) represented independently of extensions, and (ii) structured objects which can be modified as a result of learning. We use Type Theory with Records (TTR), a formal semantics framework that starts from the idea that information and meaning is founded on our ability to perceive and classify the world, i.e. to perceive objects and situations as being of types. As an example of our approach, we show how a simple classifier of spatial information based on the Perceptron can be cast in TTR.},

It claims that each term has three types of meanings, basic, deictic and intrinsic, and that the definitions of each type of meaning are identical in form for all six terms. Restrictions on the use of the terms, which are different for above and below than for the rest, are explained by a general constraint on all uses of spatial relational terms, the framework vertical constraint. This constraint depends on the existence of a fourth type of meaning for above and below, one defined by the framework in which the related objects are located. It is argued that a theory centred on the framework vertical constraint is preferable to one centred on the principle of canonical orientation (Levelt, 1984). R\'esum\'e Cet article offre une description unifi\'ee du sens des termes d\'ecrivant des relations spatiales (\`a droite de, \`a gauche de, devant, derri\`ere, au dessus de et au dessous de). L'article propose que chaque terme poss\`ede trois sortes de sens - sens de base, sens d\'eictique et sens intrins\`eque - dont les d\'efinitions sont formellement identiques pour les six termes. Les restrictions dans l'usage de ces termes, qui sont diff\'erentes pour au dessus de et au dessous de et pour les autres termes, s'expliquent par une contrainte g\'en\'erale \`a toute utilisation de termes de relations spatiales, la contrainte du cadre vertical. Cette contrainte d\'epend de l'existence d'un quatri\'eme type de sens pour au dessus de et au dessous de, sens d\'efini par le cadre spatial dans lequel se situent les objets.

Searle's article had the advantage of stirring up discussion about when and how symbols could be about things in the world, whether intelligence involves representations or not, and what embodiment means and under what conditions cognition is embodied. But almost twentyfive years of philosophical discussion have shed little light on the issue, partly because the discussion has been mixed up with emotional arguments whether artificial intelligence is possible or not. However today I believe that sufficient progress has been made in cognitive science and AI so that we can say that the symbol grounding problem has been solved.

Visual questions selectively target different areas of an image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a system that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of the image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions. Moreover, VQA is amenable to automatic evaluation, since many open-ended answers contain only a few words or a closed set of answers that can be provided in a multiple-choice format. We provide a dataset containing \textasciitilde{}0.25M images, \textasciitilde{}0.76M questions, and \textasciitilde{}10M answers (www.visualqa.org), and discuss the information it provides.

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

However, training is typically done in a way that is not specific to the localization task. First a binary classifier is trained using a sample of positive and negative examples, and this classifier is subsequently applied to multiple regions within test images. We propose instead to treat object localization in a principled way by posing it as a problem of predicting structured data: we model the problem not as binary classification, but as the prediction of the bounding box of objects located in images. The use of a joint-kernel framework allows us to formulate the training procedure as a generalization of an SVM, which can be solved efficiently. We further improve computational efficiency by using a branch-and-bound strategy for localization during both training and testing. Experimental evaluation on the PASCAL VOC and TU Darmstadt datasets show that the structured training procedure improves performance over binary training as well as the best previously published scores.},

  abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

  abstract = {Image-based soft sensors are of interest in process industries due to their cost-effective and non-intrusive properties. Unlike most multivariate inputs, images are highly dimensional, requiring the use of feature extractors to produce lower dimension representations. These extractors have a large impact on final sensor performance. Traditional texture feature extraction methods consider limited feature types, requiring expert knowledge to select and may be sensitive to changing imaging conditions. Deep learning methods are an alternative which does not suffer these drawbacks. A specific deep learning method, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), mitigates the curse of dimensionality inherent in fully connected networks but must be trained, unlike other feature extractors. This allows both textural and spectral features to be discovered and utilised. A case study consisting of platinum flotation froth images at four distinct platinum-grades was used. Extracted feature sets were used to train linear and nonlinear soft sensor models. The quality of CNN features was compared to those from traditional texture feature extraction methods. Performance of CNNs as feature extractors was found to be competitive, showing similar performance to the other texture feature extractors. However, the dataset also exhibits strong spectral features, complicating comparison between texture feature extractors. The results gathered do not provide sufficient information to distinguish between the types of features detected by the CNN and further investigation is required.},

  abstract = {We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.

The "words as classifiers" model of grounded semantics views words as classifiers of perceptual contexts, and composes the meaning of a phrase through composition of the denotations of its component words. It was recently shown to perform well in a game-playing scenario with a small number of object types. We apply it to two large sets of real-world photographs that contain a much larger variety of types and for which referring expressions are available. Using a pre-trained convolutional neural network to extract image features, and augmenting these with in-picture positional information, we show that the model achieves performance competitive with the state of the art in a reference resolution task (given expression, find bounding box of its referent), while, as we argue, being conceptually simpler and more flexible.},

The book contains an introduction to type theory from the point of view of linguistics and the philosophy of language. Type theory is then applied in the areas of quantification, anaphora, temporal reference, and the structure of text and discourse. In virtue of the type theoretical concepts of proof object and context, various phenomena of dependence and progression in language can be discussed in precise terms, and several well-known problems can be solved.},

For example, the pictures comprised a person holding an object with the function of protection from falling objects (e.g., an umbrella). Each picture was depicted with the object shown as fulfilling its function or not at different geometric positions. The results of Experiment 1 show a significant effect of functional relations on the ratings given. However, while over/under were very sensitive to functional relations, above/below were more influenced by geometric relations. The second experiment replicates these effects with objects depicting noncanonical functions (e.g., a suitcase sheltering someone from rain). Experiment 3 manipulated frame of reference and found evidence for conflict of frames of reference effects on the rating of above/below, but not in the same way for over/under. Conversely the ratings of over/under were found to be affected by functionality while those for above/below were not. These results indicate for the first time that spatial prepositions are differentially influenced by geometric and functional relations.},

I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal powers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4. "Could a machine think?" On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking.},
