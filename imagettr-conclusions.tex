It works and it's nice because...
robustness, type checking, verifiable (?)



\subsection{Future work}

Spatial templates \& regions of acceptability. Compound relations (above right) finer (directly). Functional aspect.  \cite{LoganComputationalAnalysisApprehension1996} (also Dobnik etc)

Basic->Deictic->Intrinsic relations  \cite{LoganComputationalAnalysisApprehension1996}. 3D.

4 question types.
Moar question types (tasks/programs/routines in L\&S).

Dialogue.

Classification after Q.

Probabilistic TTR for ``good fit'' (is is more to the left or more above?).

Negation.
